To use this MSU pack, you must purchase both soundtracks from the Hat in Time game on Steam, both Original Soundtrack, and B-Side. Once you have these [Steam > steamapps > common > HatinTime > Soundtrack & Soundtrack (B-Side)], copy all files, or just the files listed in hit.json into the Tracks folder. Then, drag the hit json onto the msupcm app to automatically generate the pcm files needed.

If you'd like to determine what tracks are what, just open hit.json in your favorite text/code editor and read through it. Note that you can change the options within the json to change songs.

If there's a song that you'd prefer for a situation, open the song up in audacity, and use the start/end selections in that to determine where you want it to end, and loop back to, and it should be easy to add yourself :)

To immediately use this for alttp randomizer, after doing the track stuff ive listed above, just generate a rom from the alttpr website wit "Background Music" set to YES, rename the file to "hit_lttp" (very required) and then run on snes9x 1.56 or higher. There's other emulators that work, but it takes different methods. SD2SNES works the same as Snes9x so its also this easy.
